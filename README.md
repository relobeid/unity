# Unity Game Development Portfolio

A collection of Unity game prototypes built with Unity. This repository showcases four different games demonstrating various game development concepts and Unity features.

## What I Built

I created four complete game prototypes using Unity 2022.3 LTS:

**Prototype 1: Vehicle Physics Simulator**
- A 3D driving game with realistic vehicle physics
- Player controls a car that can drive around a track
- Features camera following, collision detection, and smooth movement

**Prototype 2: Animal Feeding Simulation**
- A game where players feed animals that spawn randomly
- Demonstrates object spawning, collision detection, and score tracking
- Includes different animal types and food items

**Prototype 3: Endless Runner**
- A side-scrolling runner game with procedural obstacle generation
- Player character that can jump and avoid obstacles
- Features infinite scrolling and increasing difficulty

**Prototype 4: Robot Chase Game**
- A game where the player controls a robot collecting powerups
- Includes enemy spawning, wave management, and powerup systems
- Features health system and score tracking

## Technologies Used

**Game Engine & Development**
- Unity 2022.3 LTS
- C# programming language
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- Unity Input System
- Unity Physics engine

**Web Deployment**
- Unity WebGL build target
- HTML5/CSS3 for web interface
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment

**Version Control & Collaboration**
- Git for source control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- Automated deployment workflows

## Key Features Implemented

**Game Mechanics**
- Player input handling and movement systems
- Physics-based interactions and collision detection
- Object spawning and lifecycle management
- Score tracking and game state management

**Technical Implementation**
- Component-based architecture using Unity's GameObject system
- Event-driven programming for game events
- Performance optimization through object pooling
- Responsive design for web deployment

**Web Integration**
- Unity WebGL builds for browser compatibility
- Custom HTML interface with retro space theme
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Automated deployment to GitHub Pages

## Development Process

This project was built following Unity's Create with Code course curriculum. Each prototype builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and expanding the player's understanding of game development fundamentals.

The development process involved:
- Learning Unity basics and C# programming
- Implementing game mechanics step by step
- Testing and debugging gameplay elements
- Optimizing performance for web deployment
- Creating a cohesive web interface for all games

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for these prototypes include:
- Sound effects and background music
- More complex enemy AI behaviors
- Additional powerup types and effects
- Level progression systems
- Mobile touch controls for web version
